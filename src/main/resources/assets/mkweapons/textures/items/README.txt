All tools currently in this folder use the same texture map. Bows, Swords, Maces. They all use the same texture file
Using "Iron_Tool" will set the tool colours to iron. Likewise if you need a new colour, like a blue mythral blade,
just recoulor the iron texture to the shade you want and it will be universaly used across all the tools.
There is also a "Guilded_steel_tool" texture to show this off a bit more. Same steel colour scheme. But with a golden Hilt. :)
